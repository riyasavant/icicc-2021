                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Abstract:</h5>
                        <p>Abstract: Segmentation of infections from CT scans is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up in tackling the COVID-19. Although the convolutional neural network has great potential to automatic the segmentation task, most existing deep learning-based infection segmentation methods require fully annotated ground-truth labels for training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this talk, I will talk about our recent research on novel weakly supervised segmentation for COVID-19 infections in CT slices which only requires scribble supervision, enhanced with uncertainty-aware self-ensembling and transformation-consistent techniques. Specifically, to deal with the difficulty caused by the shortage of supervision, uncertainty-aware mean teacher model is incorporated into the scribble-based segmentation method, which encourage the segmentation predictions to be consistent under different perturbations for an input image. The mean teacher model can guide the student model training with the usage of information in images without requiring their annotations. Considering the output of the mean teacher contains correct predictions and unreliable predictions, equally treating each prediction in teacher model may degrade the performance of student network. To alleviate the problem, the pixel level uncertainty measure on the predictions of the teacher model is calculated and the student model is only guided by reliable predictions from the teacher model. To further regularize the network, transformation-consistent strategy is also incorporated, which requires the prediction to follow the same transformation if a transform is performed on an input image of the network. The proposed method is investigated on two public datasets and a local dataset, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than other weakly supervised methods and report similar performance with fully supervised methods.</p>
